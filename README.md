# airQualitySensor_airrohr
This is a PCB and design for an air quality sensor unit using the airrohr/luftdaten/sensor.community design

This is a PCB design (in KiCAD) and laser cut enclosure plate design to make an air quality sensor node for inclusion in the https://luftdaten.info/ air quality data monitoring site (now called https://sensor.community/en/)

I think the project is amazing and produced this design for a simplified, but robust DIY kit.

This is heavily based on these two open-source projects:

https://github.com/CivicLabsBelgium/influencair-pcb

https://github.com/Naesstrom/Airrohr-kit

The second link (by Erik Näsström) is a great design. I wanted to, very slightly, simplify this and produce a unit that does not need a 3d printer. I set about designing laser cut parts for this.

The PCB is very simple, but has been produced in the totally open-source PCB design package KiCAD.
